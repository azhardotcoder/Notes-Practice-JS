//todo -------------------Java Script -----------------------
//*     1.  JavaScript is a single-threaded language, which means it has only one call stack and one memory heap.
//*     2.  Syncronous programming: In synchronous programming, the code is executed sequentially from top-to-bottom.

//todo ------------------- Execution context -----------------------
// Execute one line of code at a time
// 1. Global Execution Context
// 2. Function Execution Context
// 3. Eval Function Execution Context


// todo ------------------ Blocking Code ---------------------
// Blocking code: In blocking code, the code is executed sequentially from top-to-bottom.

// Blocking code block the execution of the code until the current code is executed.


//todo ----------------- Non-Blocking Code -------------------
// Non-Blocking code: In non-blocking code, the code is executed simultaneously from top-to-bottom.

// Non-blocking code does not block the execution of the code. It allows the execution of the code to continue while waiting for the response from the previous code.
