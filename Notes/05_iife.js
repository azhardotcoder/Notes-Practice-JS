//TODO ------- IIFE ----------
// IIFE - Immediately Invoked Function Expression
// IIFE we use to overcome global polution
// IIFE is a function that runs as soon as it is defined.
// It is a design pattern which is also known as Self-Executing Anonymous Function and contains two major parts:

/* //TODO-------code of iife------
(function () {
    console.log("Hello World");
})(); //* Whenever we use two iffe we have to use semicolon at the end of first iffe

( (name)=>{
    console.log(`My name is ${name}`);
} )("Azhar")
